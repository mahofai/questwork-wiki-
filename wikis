==== Git/Smart Git ====

<note tip>Git is a version control system</note>
====  basic command: commit/push/pull  ====
  * pull: downloads a branch from a remote repository, then immediately merges it into the current branch.  
  - could be used to track the progress of project, see if the codes have been changed.
  - pull before start branching

  * push:  It lets you move a local branch to another repository, which serves as a way to publish contributions. 
  - use it carefully, as your code will affect others code.
  - before you push, make sure you have commit all the changes to local repo.
  - if found bugs after pushing, no panic. tell your team members this issue, then just find the previous bugless version of code and upload again. then you can take your time to fix the bugs without affecting others' job.

  * commit: Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history, all stored in local repository 
  - could commit frequently, once you finish a new function or class you can commit it 
  - if made any mistakes, just use "discard" to clear the changes

<note tip>if already commit, but find bugs, just find the bugless version in history of git.log copy the codes and paste to cover current codes, then commit again. </note>

==== advance command： branch/merge ====

  * branch：  It lets you create isolated development environments within a single repository.
  - you can clone all the stuff from develop/master branch to your branch and work on your own branch
  - one feature/function one branch
  
 


  * merge: A powerful way to integrate changes from divergent branches. 
  - before you merge branch with other branch, pull that branch first, then solve the conflict manually, then merge branch
  - before merge to develop branch, pull and clone develop branch to a new branch 'release', test conflict in 'release' branch first to ensure it's compliable.

<note important>do not develop in develop branch directly, otherwise possible bugs may affect others' code and make debugging become more challenging</note>
